# stack

# Description

In this repo, I created a `Stack` class that has `push`, `pop`, and `max` methods. Also, I created a class called `Extras` which includes all the methods from the `Stack` class and a method called `mean`. the `max` and `mean` methods calculate the maximum value and the average on large number of data with a run time of `O(1)`.
